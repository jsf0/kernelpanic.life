<h2>Declarative Flowchart Making on the Command Line</h2>
<h3>16-October-2024</h3>

<p>Sooner or later, you will find yourself making a flowchart. Obviously, this is already a very unfortunate circumstance, but it gets worse, because now you're going to research all the big players in the flowchart-making space only to find that they all involve a lot of clicking and dragging and are generally very tedious.</p>

<p>This happened to me recently, as you can guess. It would be nice if I could just declare what I want my flowchart to look like and then run something to make it so. If there is a tool for this, I couldn't find it, and I'm obviously not going to pay big SaaS money for it anyway, so I made one.</p>

<p>I called it <a href="https://github.com/jsf0/chartctl">chartctl</a> and it's pretty simple. It will take a JSON file containing your desired flowchart config, and its internal sausage machine will make a PNG out of it. Here's a simple example of that JSON:</p>
<pre>
<code>
{
  "nodes": {
    "start": { "label": "Start Process" },
    "approval": { "label": "Request Approval" },
    "approved": { "label": "Approved" },
    "rejected": { "label": "Rejected" },
    "retry": { "label": "Retry Request" },
    "end": { "label": "End Process" }
  },
  "connectors": [
    { "from": "start", "to": "approval" },
    { "from": "approval", "to": "approved", "label": "Yes" },
    { "from": "approval", "to": "rejected", "label": "No" },
    { "from": "rejected", "to": "retry", "label": "Retry?" },
    { "from": "retry", "to": "approval" },
    { "from": "approved", "to": "end" }
  ]
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>"nodes" are the processes, decision points, and start/end blocks in your flowchart. "connectors" are the lines connecting them. You can call your nodes whatever you want. You can label your connectors whatever you want.</p>

<p>Create the flowchart out of this like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ chartctl -i request_process.json -o request_process</code></pre>
<p>This will generate the following PNG:</p>

<p>You can optionally add shapes and/or colors to the nodes and connectors too:</p>
<pre>
<code>
{
  "nodes": {
    "start": { "label": "Start Process", "shape": "oval", "fillcolor": "lightblue", "style": "filled" },
    "approval": { "label": "Request Approval", "shape": "diamond", "fillcolor": "yellow", "style": "filled" },
    "approved": { "label": "Approved", "shape": "rectangle", "fillcolor": "lightgreen", "style": "filled" },
    "rejected": { "label": "Rejected", "shape": "rectangle", "fillcolor": "lightcoral", "style": "filled" },
    "retry": { "label": "Retry Request", "shape": "rectangle", "fillcolor": "lightgray", "style": "filled" },
    "end": { "label": "End Process", "shape": "oval", "fillcolor": "lightblue", "style": "filled" }
  },
  "connectors": [
    { "from": "start", "to": "approval" },
    { "from": "approval", "to": "approved", "label": "Yes", "color": "green" },
    { "from": "approval", "to": "rejected", "label": "No", "color": "red" },
    { "from": "rejected", "to": "retry", "label": "Retry?", "color": "orange" },
    { "from": "retry", "to": "approval" },
    { "from": "approved", "to": "end" }
  ]
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Adding those color and shape directives will create the following flowchart:</p>

<p>There's probably bugs and limitations with it, but it is Certified Good Enough for me.</p>
