<h2>OpenBSD 6.9 Router Benchmarks</h2>
<h3>21-May-2021</h3>

<img src="/img/openbsd-routers.jpg" alt="OpenBSD Routers">

<p>I've been using OpenBSD for my home router/gateway for years, and have run it on a number of different types of hardware. I recently got Verizon's gigabit service which is advertised at up to 940 Mb/s download and 880 Mb/s upload speeds, so I decided to benchmark some of the routers I have laying around. The contestants are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite:</strong> dual core 500 Mhz Cavium Octeon, Cavium ethernet using cnmac driver</li>
	<li><strong>PC Engines APU4:</strong> quad core 1 GHz AMD GX-412TC Jaguar, Intel i211AT ethernet with em driver</li>
	<li><strong>Ubiquiti EdgeRouter 4:</strong> quad core 1 GHz Cavium Octeon, Cavium ethernet with cnmac driver</li>
	<li><strong>Supermicro E300-8D:</strong> quad core 2.2 GHz Intel Xeon D-1518 (SMT disabled), Intel I210 ethernet with em driver</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these routers are running OpenBSD 6.9 and are set up exactly as described in the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/example1.html">Building a Router</a> FAQ page. There are lots of tweaks people do for performance, but I did not test any of them. What you see in the guide is what you get. CPU frequency was set at the maximum via apmd, where applicable.</p>

<p>Testing was done from a T14 running Ubuntu 20.04 with 3 runs at Speedtest.net using the Vultr speed test server. This is not perfect as it only tests web traffic, so smaller or larger packet sizes than what you find in web traffic are not tested, nor is UDP tested either. Since this is going to an external server outside my network, it also sends that traffic over other carriers, so some of this is at the mercy of the route. But this is not meant to be scientific, and probably represents how most people will use their router anyway.</p>

<p>Results are below, (averaged over the 3 tests):</p>

<ul>
	<li>EdgeRouter Lite: <strong>114.63</strong> Mb/s download, <strong>106.74</strong> Mb/s upload</li>
	<li>APU4: <strong>358.02</strong> Mb/s download, <strong>328.42</strong> Mb/s upload</li>
	<li>EdgeRouter 4: <strong>462.23</strong> Mb/s download, <strong>411.59</strong> Mb/s upload</li>
	<li>E300-8D: <strong>752.52</strong> Mb/s download, <strong>884.58</strong> Mb/s upload</li>
</ul>

<p>The EdgeRouter Lite has a small ASIC onboard for packet forwarding which is used by Ubiquiti's EdgeOS. OpenBSD does not use this at all, so all of this was done by the two 500 MHz cores. One interesting thing is that the EdgeRouter 4 was signifcantly faster than the APU4, beating it by about 100 Mb/s. Despite the fact that both have four 1 GHz cores, the Octeon apparently moves packets around better than the AMD Jaguar. The fastest in the list is unsurprisingly the Xeon powered Supermicro E300, and it likely can go faster, but the connection may have been the limitation here.</p>

<p>I am currently using the Supermicro as my router, though my favorite device is the EdgeRouter 4 here for the best balance of speed and low power consumption. The E300's fans have a very whiny pitch to them that has made me relegate this machine to the basement. On the plus side, it has IPMI, and it is fast enough to be usable for other purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There was some criticism of using Speedtest.net as the test method, which I expected and I agree with it. I ran the following tests with iperf3 to see if there would be a difference. I did not test the Supermicro in this manner. iperf3 was running on the Supermicro in server mode, and the T14 laptop was connecting through the tested router to the iperf3 server on the Supermicro for all of these tests. These were with iperf3's default options.</p>

<p>I also tried with and without the scrub and antispoof lines in pf.conf to see if that would make any difference. See below for the results:</p>

<p>I also measured the power consumption of each of these from the wall at idle and under load:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>EdgeRouter Lite:</strong> 6.9 watts idle, 7.4 watts max</li>
	<li><strong>APU4:</strong> 6.4 watts idle, 7.3 watts max</li>
	<li><strong>EdgeRouter 4:</strong> 6.9 watts idle, 7.5 watts max</li>
</ul> 

<p>There was little discernible difference in power consumption between these, and they could be within the margin of error of the device I used to measure.</p>

<p><strong>Update 11-June-2021</strong>: The APU4 was on an old BIOS when tested, which did not support boosting CPU core clock speed under load. This is a feature added in v4.9.0.2, and will boost to 1.4 GHz. I updated the BIOS to v4.13.06 and re-ran the tests on the APU4, which can be seen below (tested for 60 seconds with 6 second interval):</p>
